Initial Version Demo Video: https://fanyangmeng.blog/introducing-odoo-expert/

> ⚠️ PLEASE NOTE: This project is in ALPHA stage
> This is an early release that is still under heavy development. Breaking changes can and will happen at any time without prior notice. The API, database schema, and core functionality may change significantly between versions. While we welcome testing and feedback, this version is not recommended for production use.
> This project is not sponsored or endrosed by Odoo S.A. or Odoo Inc. yet. I am developing this project as a personal project with the intention of helping the Odoo community on my own.

A comprehensive documentation processing and chat system that converts Odoo's documentation to a searchable knowledge base with an AI-powered chat interface. This tool supports multiple Odoo versions (16.0, 17.0, 18.0) and provides semantic search capabilities powered by OpenAI embeddings.

## Initial Intention Behind This Project

The project was conceived with the vision of enhancing the Odoo documentation experience. The goal was to create a system similar to Perplexity or Google, where users could receive AI-powered answers directly within the documentation website, complete with proper source links. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate through complex documentation structures.

## How it works?

    style E fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

The system operates through a pipeline of data processing and serving steps:

1. **Documentation Pulling**: Fetches raw documentation from Odoo's repositories
2. **Format Conversion**: Converts RST files to Markdown for better AI processing
3. **Embedding Generation**: Processes Markdown files and stores them with embeddings
4. **Interface Layer**: Provides both UI and API access to the processed knowledge base

## Features

### Core Functionality

- Documentation Processing: Automated conversion of RST to Markdown with smart preprocessing

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- OpenAI API access
- Git

if you want to do source install, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.10+
- Pandoc
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

## Installation & Usage

Assuming the table name is `odoo_docs`. If you have a different table name, please update the table name in the following SQL commands.

### Docker Compose Install

1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file to your local machine.
2. Set up environment variables in the `.env` file by using the `.env.example` file as a template.
   ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    POSTGRES_DB=odoo_expert
    POSTGRES_HOST=db
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
    BEARER_TOKEN=comma_separated_bearer_tokens
    CORS_ORIGINS=comma_separated_cors_origins
   ```
3. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4. Pull the raw data and write to your PostgreSQL's table:
    ```bash
    # Pull documentation
    docker compose run --rm odoo-expert ./pull_rawdata.sh

    # Convert RST to Markdown
    docker compose run --rm odoo-expert python main.py process-raw --raw-dir ./raw_data --output-dir ./markdown

    # Process documents
    docker compose run --rm odoo-expert python main.py process-docs ./markdown
    ```
5. Access the UI at port 8501 and the API at port 8000
6. Docker compose will automatically pull the latest changes and update the system once a day, or you can manually update by running the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm odoo-expert python main.py check-updates
    ```

### Source Install

1. Install PostgreSQL and pgvector:
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    
    # Install pgvector extension
    git clone https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
    cd pgvector
    make
    make install
    ```

2. Create database and enable extension:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE odoo_expert;
    \c odoo_expert
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    ```

3. Set up the database schema by running the SQL commands in `src/sqls/init.sql`.

4. Pull Odoo documentation:
    ```bash
    chmod +x pull_rawdata.sh
    ./pull_rawdata.sh
    ```

5. Convert RST to Markdown:
    ```bash
    python main.py process-raw --raw-dir ./raw_data --output-dir ./markdown
    ```

6. Process and embed documents:
    ```bash
    python main.py process-docs ./markdown
    ```

7. Launch the chat interface:
    ```bash
    python main.py serve --mode ui
    ```

8. Launch the API:
    ```bash
    python main.py serve --mode api
    ```

9. Access the UI at port 8501 and the API at port 8000

10. To sync with the latest changes in the Odoo documentation, run:
    ```bash
    python main.py check-updates
    ```

## API Endpoints

## Future Roadmap

Please see [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MFYDev/odoo-expert/issues) for the future roadmap.

## What Are the Potential Applications?

While initially focused on Odoo documentation, the system's architecture makes it highly adaptable for various documentation management scenarios:

- Internal knowledge base systems
- Technical documentation portals
- Customer support systems
- Educational content management
- API documentation assistance

The underlying RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture can be extended to process and serve any structured documentation, making it valuable for organizations looking to enhance their documentation accessibility and searchability.
